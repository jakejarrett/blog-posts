# Design systems
### What are they?
<p>Design systems are a way of providing a more seamless experience between the Design & Frontend teams.</p>
<p>
  These can include things from Styleguides all the way to engineered <br />
  solutions that have Designers being able to visually change components & <br />
  those changes being pushed to NPM as a react component
</p>

# Storybook
<p>
  Storybook is a tool in the design systems which is used in PointsBet &
  <br />
  Many other companies to provide to provide a better experience between Code & Design.
</p>
<p>
  Storybook provides you the ability to present individual components to developers & <br />
  other shareholders in a convenient & useful way.
</p>

# How we use Storybook at PointsBet
<p>
  We use storybook in PR builds to allow developers to conveniently see components without running anything locally.
</p>
<p>
  This allows developers to review PRs more confidently
  (We can visually see if the PR broke stuff without locally installing & checking out to their branch).
</p>

# Other benefits of Storybook
<ul>
  <li>Allows you to develop truely isolated components</li>
  <li>
    Enforces component driven architecture, allowing me to use real PB Components in this presentation. <br />
    <b>(Edit; This was edited to remove references to the internal style library. but it was in theme for the app using mdx etc)</b>
  </li>
</ul>
